    <p>Fortune 29 (Moderately Fortunate)</p>
<p>Blood runs deep, and family is your eternal safe harbour. If you have been toiling far from home, <br>remember to reach out to your elders; this fortune suggests that family will bring you strength and <br>support. Perhaps a relative is quietly keeping you in their thoughts—your hello will be the greatest <br>comfort to them. In the wisdom passed down through your family lies guidance as well. Sit down <br>for a heartfelt talk with a parent or elder, and you may receive unexpected insight and counsel that <br>inspire you.</p>
